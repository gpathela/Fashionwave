          <b>OUR RETURN AND EXCHANGE POLICY</b>
          <br><br>
          <b>CHANGED YOUR MIND?</b>
          <p>If you change your mind about the products you have purchased from us (it happens, you’re human), we can refund the purchase price or exchange those products in the country in which they were purchased subject to the following conditions:</p>
          <ul>

          <li>Item(s) must be returned within 30 days of purchase, together with proof of purchase.</li>
          <li>Items from the Cotton On Kids Baby and Cotton On Kids Swimwear range can be returned up to 60 days from the date of purchase, subject to all other terms and conditions in this policy.</li>
          <li>Item(s) must be unworn, unwashed, or otherwise unused with all original tags/labels attached. Returns for swimwear will be accepted if the protective gusset and labelling have not been removed. Underwear, earrings and cosmetics cannot be returned or exchanged because that’s gross!</li>

          <p>Shipping costs can’t be refunded if there are other items listed on the original invoice that you aren't returning. That’s fair, right? </p>
